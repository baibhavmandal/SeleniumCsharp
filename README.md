## **Project Overview**

This project tests input fields inside forms across various challenging scenarios. These scenarios are designed to simulate how forms or elements might be structured in real-world applications:

### **Form Scenarios**
1. **Normal Form:** A simple form located on the webpage.
2. **Nested iframes:** 
   - One iframe (`iframe1`) contains another iframe (`iframe2`), which in turn contains:
     - A form.
     - Another iframe (`iframe3`) with another nested form.
3. **Iframe with an ID:** A uniquely identified iframe containing a form.
4. **Shadow DOMs:** A deeply nested structure with 5 levels of shadow DOMs, each containing a form.

### **Objective**
The goal is to test and validate input fields inside each form across these scenarios.

## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in **Visual Studio 2022**.
3. Run the tests to validate input fields in different form setups.

## **Learning and Building**

This project reflects my journey of learning C# and Selenium. Along the way, I explored the following concepts:
- Navigating iframes.
- Handling Shadow DOMs.
- Writing reusable test code.
- Utilizing CSS selectors for locating elements.
